		<p align="justify"> New Long-Range radio technologies have recently emerged in the IoT landscape. These technologies work in the Sub-GHz bands, allowing low-power communications over long distances. As a result, LoRa is now been considered a candidate radio technology for many wireless sensor network (WSN) applications, especially those that require extended coverage such as smart city, wildlife or infrastructure monitoring. Nonetheless, WSN researchers have produced a vast number of energy efficient networking protocols, raising the question of how much of the last decade research outcome is actually applicable to LoRa base networks and can be re-used without reinventing the wheel. To address this question, the <a href="https://github.com/contiki-os" target="_blank"><strong>Contiki Operating System</strong></a> can be regarded as a key enabler, as it has received wide adoption both from academia and industry, and supports various standard networking protocols such as Collection Tree Protocol (Contiki Collect), IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN), and IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The barrier, however, consists in the inability to directly run ContikiOS atop LoRa platforms. </p>

		<p align="justify"> To fill this gap, the open source Contiki port is introduced for:    
			<ol type="i">
			  <li>MSP430FR5969 Microcontroller from Texas Instruments, extending the Contiki Hardware support list. 
			  This will enable to easily interface radios that are already supported in Contiki such as CC1200, CC2420, CC2520.</li>
			  <li>Semtech LoRa radio transceiver, especially SX1276 to enable long-range application designs.</li>
			</ol>

      	<p align="justify">These instructions will guide you to get started with Contiki LoRa for development and testing purposes. To get the most out of the information outlined here, we assume the reader/user has the basic ContikiOS knowledge and how to build and compile applications. First clone the GIT repo for this port. </p>

      	 <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/rajeev1986/contikios-for-lora.git</code></pre>

      	 <p align="justify"> To kickstart, go to </p>

      	 <pre><code>examples/expfr5969/rime/unicast</code></pre>
      	 <pre><code>make</code></pre>

      	 <p align="justify"> This will compile the binaries for MSP430FR5969 Platform and you should see the following file. </p>

      	 <pre><code>example-unicast.hex</code></pre>

      	<a id="user-content-header-2" class="anchor" href="#header-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flashing the MSP430FR5969 with TI UniFlash Programmer </h2>

      	<p align="justify"> First download and install UniFlash Programmer from <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>. The <strong>example-unicast.hex</strong> is the the binary or image that you need to flash the MSP430FR5969 with. Once you have UniFlash Programmer up and running, 
      	connect the MSP430FR5969 platform. To perform flash operations on your device, you will need to launch a flash session configured for the MSP430FR5969 MCU.
      	Start a session by selecting the MSP430FR5969 from the MSP list. Once you have selected MSP430FR5969, the connection is automatically chosen for you.
      	Choose the <strong>.hex</strong> for flashing by clicking the Browse button, and then click on <strong>Load Image</strong>. Congratulations you have 
      	programmed your MSP430FR5969 successfully!</p>

      	<a id="user-content-header-2" class="anchor" href="#header-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Supported Platform</h2>
      	<p align="justify"> Current Contiki port for LoRa only supports <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/MSP430FR5969" target="_blank"><strong>MSP430FR5969 MCU</strong></a>
      	from Texas Instruments and <a href="https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-transceivers/SX1276" target="_blank"><strong>SX1276/77/78/79</strong></a> 
      	LoRa radio module from Semtech. To provide a complete sensor mote, we also open source the design of our <strong>W-LoRa</strong> platform shown below. Contiki for LoRa is optimized for W-LoRa providing all the necessary hardware and software interfaces for communicating over LoRa. </p>
